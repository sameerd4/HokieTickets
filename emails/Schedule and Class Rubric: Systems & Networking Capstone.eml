          Hi Everyone,

As promised, here is an update on all things I can think of for the coming couple weeks. [Please note the "assignments" mentioned below will be available at 5pm today on Canvas.]
*
I THE SCHEDULE:
*
Tuesday, April 14 3:30-4:45PM: Zoom ALL HANDS Meeting for the class
--> We will cover the expectations for the presentations and video/report submissions as well as answer any remaining questions you have.
Here is a Zoom link we will try to use:
https://virginiatech.zoom.us/my/prof.cameron
*
Thursday, April 16 3:30-4:45PM: Select team meetings during class
--> This is time we can use if your team would like to meet during this week. This is not required, I just want to set aside time for anyone that wants to meet.
*
Tuesday, April 21 3:30-4:45PM:
Thursday, April 23 3:30-4:45PM:
*
Friday, April 24 11:59PM: Term Project "Report" is DUE
--> See the assignments for details, but basically, you need to upload a PDF with some information (team name, etc. + link to repo + uploaded video file name, etc.).
--> Notably, VT Blockchain Challenge submits are also due on April 24 by midnight.
--> Finalists will be asked to present on Zoom May 4, 3-5PM.
*
Saturday, May 9 7:45-9:45AM: Final Class Presentations (Zoom)
*
II CLASS RUBRIC
*
All grades to date are posted on Canvas as well as all remaining assignments. Only the Term Project "Report" listed above requires a direct submission (a PDF with some info and a video upload + link to repo). The other remaining assignments (Term Project and Final Presentation) are just placeholders with descriptions so I can post your grades later.
*
Here is the rubric we will use (from the syllabus) and some notes:
*
10% Project Proposal (done)
15% Gannt Work Plan (done)
10% Final Project Report (Upload PDF to Canvas, Video to google drive, due April 24, Repo due May 1) See assignment description for details.
50% Term Project (DUE April 24, nothing to submit) See assignment description for details.
10% Final Project Presentation/Demo (nothing to submit, Prexo on May 9, 2020 7:45AM-9:45AM) See assignment description for details.
5% Meeting minutes and attendance at team meetings (Expect to do well unless you've been told otherwise, at final exam you will be asked to submit reviews of prezos)
*
That's how your letter grade will be calculated. I've pushed you all pretty hard so far and I expect everyone to do well...but don't let off the throttle :-) Assuming of course you are going to stick with standard grading (which would be my advice). I will of course allow anyone that needs to apply the Provost-approved alternative grading as needed. I will try to post your final letter grade after the presentations so you can let me know if you'd like to exercise the Provost's options.

If you have any questions or I left anything out you need more information on, drop me an email or ask me on Tuesday April 14 when we all meet.

Stay safe and healthy,

Dr. Cameron
